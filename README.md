# Revision2022


***Biggest Pain:***
               Not having one central easily accessible medium to store and retrieve notes(including links, both visited and to be visited).
               Have made plan multiple times offline(diary, notepad, Big Charts, excel).. but I have moved across cities frequently in past and offline
               plans are not always accessible to me as i forget packing these often since trave is planned on the spur of the moment.
               The digital platforms, each has its limitations.. and features needed locked for premium package i.e. not accessible on basic plans which
               have (e.g. ToDoIst)
               
**I think this will help solve this pain:** Github's Guide on [Start Writing on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#GitHub-flavored-markdown)
 Already using it while writing on this page of github ðŸŒž
 Utilized these sections already in this para: Styling Texts :smile:, Using Links :smile:, Adding emoji's :smile:
 
 
 ### I Badly need a Plan 
 
 - Helps do Reality Check of actual progress made Vs planned.. and 
   course correct(align myself back to the plan) or revise plan(if diversion from plan was a value add thus progressively elaborating the plan ðŸ§µ Added the emoji of thread: to highlight that when we are preparing for Google Interview.. although we want it to be the only pursuit of our mind but reality is we execute or plan or aspire or imagine or dream.. about more than 1 pursuits and brain has multiple threads working parallely on each of these.. which are spawned on need basis and context switched to something next due to some stimulus in our environment and the environment we are in is not in our full control)
 - Recently came to know that writing it down makes it a commitment rather than just one of 100's everyday aspirations that I tend to forget within minutes
