# Revision2022


***Biggest Pain:***
               Not having one central easily accessible medium to store and retrieve notes(including links, both visited and to be visited).
               Have made plan multiple times offline(diary, notepad, Big Charts, excel).. but I have moved across cities frequently in past and offline
               plans are not always accessible to me as i forget packing these often since trave is planned on the spur of the moment.
               The digital platforms, each has its limitations.. and features needed locked for premium package i.e. not accessible on basic plans which
               have (e.g. ToDoIst)
               
**I think this will help solve this pain:** Github's Guide on [Start Writing on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#GitHub-flavored-markdown)
 Already using it while writing on this page of github üåû
 Utilized these sections already in this para: Styling Texts :smile:, Using Links :smile:, Adding emoji's :smile:
 
 
 ### I Badly need a Plan 
 
 - Helps do Reality Check of actual progress made Vs planned.. and 
   course correct(align myself back to the plan) or revise plan(if diversion from plan was a value add thus progressively elaborating the plan üßµ 
   ###### Emoji Trivia 
   Added the emoji of thread: to highlight that when we are preparing for Google Interview.. although we want it to be the only pursuit of our mind but reality is we execute or plan or aspire or imagine or dream.. about more than 1 pursuits and brain has multiple threads working parallely on each of these.. which are spawned on need basis and context switched to something next due to some stimulus in our environment and the environment we are in is not in our full control.. after all we play multiple roles in a day and each role we play has its own set of these triggers(planning, execution, aspirations, expectations, imaginations, dreams, ...success, falures, excitements, disappointments, ...) üë™, üßë‚Äçüè≠, üêï üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
 - Recently came to know that writing it down makes it a commitment rather than just one of 100's everyday aspirations that I tend to forget within minutes

- [ ] since resigned and around before that: all free time not enjoyed freely.. travelled with books for google prep.. stayed at a place giving less distraction to study, constantly google on mind..almost 2.5 months of job free days aspiring for Google job.. and still cont..
- [ ] alternate utilization of these 2.5 months: paint, travel destinations, some app building for self commercial launch, Bansuri vadan perfected.. all these are pushed to be done in future as priority is Google (to work with qualified people - assumption: with such rigotous selection process, good and technially sound people will be part of google so less politics)
- [ ] lots of Youtube videos on motivation for myself, inspiration .. making self more productive to achieve my goal is stipulated time frame - Jim Kwik.
- [ ] Shresta's time to hear his story of preparing to reach this level of expertise.
