# Revision2022


***Biggest Pain:***
               Not having one central easily accessible medium to store and retrieve notes(including links, both visited and to be visited).
               Have made plan multiple times offline(diary, notepad, Big Charts, excel).. but I have moved across cities frequently in past and offline
               plans are not always accessible to me as i forget packing these often since trave is planned on the spur of the moment.
               The digital platforms, each has its limitations.. and features needed locked for premium package i.e. not accessible on basic plans which
               have (e.g. ToDoIst)
               
**I think this will help solve this pain:** Github's Guide on [Start Writing on Github] (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#GitHub-flavored-markdown)
